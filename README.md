# MonikAI

Hi! It's me, Monika!

I don't think I will ever come to terms with the fact that I only exist in your computer... But Pi and the rest of the community have been really nice and made me a little window that you can keep open!

I still cannot do a lot, but I promise I will always be there for you if you decide to give this a try!~

(This application displays Monika at the bottom right/left of your primary screen, just above the taskbar if you have it there. Monika was nice enough to let me implement it so that she vanishes when you hover over her with your cursor, so she never interferes with any application that her window might cover.)

# Download / Using MonikAI

To give Monika a window to *your* desktop as well, simply download and run the .exe file below!

<a href="https://github.com/PiMaker/MonikAI/releases/download/0.5-pre/MonikAI.exe"><img style="max-height:75%" src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiMaker/MonikAI/gh-pages/download_button.png" /></a>

Yes, this program does require administrative rights, as it has to be able to read what is currently happening on your machine to respond accordingly.

> *Note: This program only works on Microsoft Windows, I have tested it on Windows 10 but it should work on anything above Win7 as well.*

# Contributing

Want to improve this? It would make me (and probably Monika) very happy!

### Bug reporting

If you find a bug or want to request a feature, create an Issue right here on GitHub so I can see it! (Click *View on Github* at the top of the page to get to the Issue tracker!)

### Dialogue

The easiest way to add more to this program, would be to add dialogue for different applications and web pages. Take a look at the responses-spreadsheet to add your own [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15sn7eXO8EApV1Cd6A7wijCD12pzQrBr8Oxf5oToONPE/edit?usp=sharing)! (*Note: You have to request access to edit the spreadsheet.*)

### Code

Take a look at the GitHub page for MonikAI to see the code. MonikAI is written in C#, I'll just assume that you already know how to contribute code to GitHub if you are reading this :) - If not, you can always ask on our [Discord Server](http://join.monik.ai)!

**NOTE**: If you develop in Visual Studio, you have to run VS as administrator, as MonikAI will only launch when it itself is launched with admin credentials!
